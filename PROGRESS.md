# Progress

## Phase 1 — voxel world + player (done)
- Done: flat-array World (get/set/dirty/DDA raycast), greedy mesher with vertex colour + patterns + AO + transparent pass in 2 Workers, per-voxel jitter in the fragment shader, Desert Highway terrain (dunes + road) generated in a Worker, AABB FPS controller with step-up and pointer lock, F3 debug overlay, 9 Vitest tests.
- Next: phase 2 destruction (applyDamage, pistol/pickaxe/grenade, Rapier debris, volatile chain, effects, synth audio).
- Blockers: none.
- FPS: real GPU fps not measurable in the build sandbox (headless SwiftShader). Mesher: 2.7 ms avg per 32³ chunk in the Worker; world gen 80–130 ms; player sweep 180 steps in 3 ms.
- Open decisions: see DECISIONS.md.

## Phase 0 — scaffold (done)
- pnpm workspace, Vite+TS+Three.js, Hono server, Vitest, Playwright screenshots. Docker deferred.
